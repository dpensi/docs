Pi-gen is the tool used to create the official *Raspberry Pi OS* images. We use a fork of pi-gen to create OpenPlotter images. Use the *openplotter32* and *openplotter64* branches of our repository to create your own OpenPlotter flavor. You need good knowledge of Linux to create your own OpenPlotter distributions. Follow instructions in `README file <https://github.com/openplotter/pi-gen/>`_.
